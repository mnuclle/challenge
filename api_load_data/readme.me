#API_LOAD_DATA
  Api used to ingest data into the database.
  
First you have to go to the file default.py in /app/config to configure the database access. I give an example:
USER_DB = 'postgres'
PASS_DB = 'root'
URL_DB = 'localhost'
NAME_DB = 'challenge'
In this case you have to install postgresql in your pc and set this variables.
